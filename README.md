# Gitlab-runner-demo
Repo with some things that I used to do a demo of Gitlab with Gitlab runners

## ```docker-compose.yml```
This docker compose creates an instance of Gitlab.


## ```docker_runner.sh```
This script creates an instance of a Gitlab Runner and asks you for the hostname and token of your Gitlab to subscribe the Runner to it.

## ```foo```
This is a dummy repo that you can upload to the demo Gitlab.
